            <p>It's another story when it comes to video, though. You can get great video from a Pixel under the right conditions, but if you take a lot of them, you'll notice it delivers plenty of shaky or blurry videos that you wish looked better. No hate — it is what it is, and the Pixel is just behind phones like the Galaxy S series and iPhone when it comes to video.</p>

            <p>The output is something tuned to make you like it. Notice I didn't say "to make it look exactly like what your eyes see" because that's not the point. Google also collects enough user data to know what sort of pictures we end up keeping and what pictures we delete and retake, so it knows how to tune a photo in a pleasing way. We don't really want a picture where everything looks the same as it does in real life.</p>
