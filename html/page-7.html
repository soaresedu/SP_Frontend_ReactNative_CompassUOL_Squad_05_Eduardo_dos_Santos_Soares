            <p>Thankfully, several options on the market offer a great experience without sacrificing processing power, camera quality, or overall experience. We're working to deliver the best guide for PWM/Flicker-sensitive people to make an informed buying decision and are aiming to include phones from every product category and price range.</p>

            <p>I've tested a lot of phones over the years and have been specifically testing phones for flicker sensitivity since originally posting about becoming PWM-sensitive in mid-2023. Many of these phones are also the best Android phones, and some, surprisingly, even use OLED displays. To note, if you're extremely sensitive to flickering and PWM dimming, it's safe to say most phones with OLED displays are likely not in your future.</p>
            <h3>BEST AFFORDABLE FLAGSHIP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Display: 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED, 2142 x 1080</li>
                <li>CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1</li>
                <li>RAM: 8GB/12GBOS: Android 13, Nothing OS 2.0</li>
