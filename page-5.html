            <h2>Read our beats studio Buds Plus review</h2>
            <p>Many Hollywood productions have ground to a halt due to the ongoing labor strikes, which, for many people, provides a rare opportunity to catch up on the extensive backlog of shows and movies they may have missed. Luckily, if you’re looking for a device to up your streaming setup, Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $26.99 ($28 off), nearly matching its all-time low.</p>
            <img id="image" src="images/556454.jfif" alt="">
            <p>At its core, the Fire Stick 4K Max is a straightforward 4K streamer that makes the most of Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa. It takes the same content-forward approach as Google’s Chromecast — a welcome approach, to be sure — while offering a slate of upgrades that make it well worth ponying up the extra $5 over the standard model. The new stick is 40 percent faster, for instance, and offers Wi-Fi 6 for better wireless performance. The ads on the homescreen and the focus on Amazon content are still a little much, but that’s also the price you pay if you want to pick up a solid streaming device for under $30.</p>
